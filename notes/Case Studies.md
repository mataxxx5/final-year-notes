# Case Studies

## What is a case study
> Think back to A-level Psyhology days, all content was in case studies. This sections needs some work, don't know how exactly to best describe case studies

Case study is a research method focused on specific subject that provides in-depth analyses and examination of the subject and its contexual relations(mostly real life cases)

Case studies investigate instnaces of cases gathering data surrounding cases and trying to generalise common factors between them, to infer something of value. 

Sometimes this isn't the case. There's only a single instance of sbuject cases to study therefore it has to be in-depth look at the case and full of valid evidence to gain some useful insights.

What kind of case study is carried out depends on the subject matter and what the researcher wants to atchieve

Types of case studies:

<strong>Illustrative case studies</strong>: descriptive studies that explore one or two instnaces of the case and try explain something that's unfamiliar to the reader. They are good at establishing understanding and common knowledge between reader and the topic.

<strong>Exploratory (or pilot) case studies</strong>: a condensed approach to case studies. They attempt to help investigators establish design of the investigation prior to carrying it out.

<strong>Cumulative case studies</strong>: This approach aims to collect findinsg of previous studies and aggregate them to allow for more generalised conclusions to be made.

<strong>Critical instance case studies</strong>: Useful in anwsering cause and effect  questions. This approach leads to focusing on one or two cases and examining the situation without focus of generalisation. Used to challenge hihly generalised assertions


## Benefits of a case study

## How to write a case study
1. case selection and categorisation
2. producion of hypothesis
3. design of the investigation
4. results
5. result based conclusion with gained insights

## Beneficial case studies for FYP

### Case studies on games
> game interaction capability, audience retention as opposed to other media, games as marketing tools, as connecting other people

### Case studies on educational posters
> posters for education, why they are used in every classroom? why they are a good teaching tool and why making them interactive would be even better
