# Plan to anwser the following question
> <h3><i><strong> What practical applications has self-organisation been used in, and what was the justification for using self-organisation in those applications?</strong></i></h3>

> <h3><font color="red"> The evidence/material has to be recent - about 5~7 year old atmost</font></h3>

## Understanding the question
> What is self-organisation? What is emergence?

Self-Organisation is defined as a process in which a system spontaneously organises itseld without control from external features.
This order isn't brought about from system's controls over it's components but rather the components interations between each other while fallowing simple individual rules.

The idea is that while unaware the components themselves bring about an emergent property which can be complex and high in value, without knowing the goal of what their actions contribute to overall. The components may interact with other components or simple fallow simple rules to produces something emergent. The main points is that they're unaware of what they're actions contribute to and that they're simple behaviour may birth something complicated and valuabe. Examples:

- Cellular Automata
- Wolfram’s Rule Number 110 - Turing-able
- Conway’s Game of Life - Turing able

## Searching for meaningful material

### Types of material
- books
- conferences
- journals
- dessertations


### Literature Search Strategy
* Identify biggest databases for relevant studies i.e <strong>IEEE, ResearchGate, Google Scholar</strong>
* Begin by looking for keywords such as ```self-organistation```
* Explore areas where topic has been applied i.e computing, robotics, bio-medical science, social, neural evolution; by using boolean operators - 'AND'
* if useful text is found use citations to traverse the network of interconnected text
* if text is too specific look up to what it cited to get a more general topic, if it's too general, look up who has cited it and with what purposes
* Find re-acurring themes and search for those with boolean operators as parameters
* search for authors

### Search Keywords

|  keyword | search attempt one |  search attempt two  |  search attempt three  |
|---|---|---|---|
| self-oganisation  |   |   |   |
| self-acting |   |   |   |
| emergence |   |   |   | 
| celular automata |   |   |   | 
| decentralisation |   |   |   | 
| synchronisation |   |   |   |
| self-similar |   |   |   | 
| self-replicating |   |   |   |
| self-government(autonamy) |   |   |   |


### Investigate
- Changes during the recent years in self-organisation
- themes between research papers
- pick a literature searching strategy 
- explore what self-organisation means
